AIM: To make led flasher
MATERIAL REQUIRED: arduino board, bread board, led, resistance, connecting wire.

PROCEDURE:
1. Take a led and put it on bread board with anode in positive side and cathode in negative side.
2. use a resistor to reduce the chance of led frying.
3. connect the led to arduino board with the help of a wire to digital input corresponding to correct pin.
4. now connect ground pin to led's cathode.
5. once the hardware is set up now prepare a code for led blinking.
6. once code is ready compile it.
7. connect the arduino board to pc.
8. select the port as arduino uno in tool section.
9. upload the code to arduino board, once it gets uploaded the led will start to turn on and off.

POINTS TO NOTE

1. led is a digital device thus it must be connected to digital pins.
2. you have to join led to correct corresponding defined pin.
3. we have to use resistor so that led dont fry up.
4. if we get uploading error we should first see if the port selected is correct or not.
5. the code we write is written in c language thus it is case sensitive, so we must use proper case while writing a code.
