AIM: to make series and parallel connection on breadboard.

MATERIAL REQUIRED: breadboard, resistor, led , battery, wires.

SERIES CIRCUIT
1. take a breadboard and connect positive and negative terminals in side of breadboard.
2. connect the two resistor such that one of the leg is in postive terminal's row and other are in i-6 and i-8 respectively.
3. connect the first led such that it's positive leg is in h-6 and negative leg is connected to negative of battery, vice versa coonect positive leg of 2nd led in h-8 and negative to negative row of battery.
4. check the connection and turn on the battery.

PARALLEL CIRCUIT
1. Take a breadboard, Two LED, Two resistance, A 9V battery, connecting wires.
2. Insert one leg of first LED into 'e' 13  and other into 'e' 14 and for second LED insert one leg in 'i' 12 and into 'i' 13.
3. Insert one leg of resistance 'j' 13 and other leg to the upper positive rail of the breadboard.
4. As we have  connected both the LED into the different rail of the board so to make connection connect one wire to both the positive terminla
   and one wire to the negative terminal of the LED.
5. Now finally connect the positive wire of battery clip to the positive terminla of the LED and negative wire to negative terminla of the LED.
6. Connect the battery clip to the battery and your LED will glow. Your parallel connection is ready. 

POINTS TO NOTE

1. check whether the connection are firm or not.
2. due to change in polarity of led in circuit can lead to non working of circuit.
3. try using colour coding for each type of wire for more easy handeling and component assembling.
4. use a battery with sufficient voltage supplying capacity.
5. handle every component carefully and try not to loose them.
