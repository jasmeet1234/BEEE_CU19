Brife Discription of Above code

Void Setup- here we define which pin we are using in the Ardiuno board.

Void Loop - here we give the information about our device wether it is output or input and tell our system wether it should 
            glow or not.

pinMode(13,OUTPUT)   - it tells the system about the pin number we are using in this case we are usnig pin no.13 and OUTPUT tells it is output pin.

digitalWrite(13,HIGH)- degitalWrite means output commnand as LED is a output device and HIGH give the command that it must glow similrally LOW means Off
